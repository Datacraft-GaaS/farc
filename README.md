# pq
A hierarchical state machine + message passing + run-to-completion framework written in Python3

In other words, a cheap knock-off of QP (www.state-machine.com).

[This book](https://newcontinuum.dl.sourceforge.net/project/qpc/doc/PSiCC2.pdf)
describes QP and how to program hierarchical state machines.
